    <p class="lead" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
The CSE department is committed for creating a community of students and faculty that reflects the diversity of the world we live in, contributing to educational excellence and a dynamic campus environment. Our goal is not only to teach students, how to use current computer applications, but rather to educate them so that they understand how these applications work and can design and build the computer applications of the future. The syllabus encompasses a broad and complete curriculum that covers the "big ideas" of computer science from hardware to software and from theory to application.

With highly qualified, trained and dedicated teachers who are responsible for the overall academic growth, the department excels in the teaching-learning methodology and has a good academic track record. The learning experience here is wholesome and tailored to suit needs of the industry and independent career development. Students are encouraged to participate in state and National level competitions covering academic, sports and cultural activities.
